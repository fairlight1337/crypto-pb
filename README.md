# crypto-pb

An extension to [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) that automatically scans stored wallet IDs for BTC (testnet and real net) for transactions.

This tool allows to integrate crypto transactions into your backend flow easily. It takes off the heavy lifting of finding the correct transactions for a wallet and storing them persistently.


## In the works

* Store the number of confirmations received
* Support ETH properly
* Assign users to wallets and transactions so only they can read them
